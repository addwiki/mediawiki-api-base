.. _installation:

Installation
========================

The recommended way to install this library is with
`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_. Composer is a dependency management tool
for PHP that allows you to declare the dependencies your project needs and
installs them into your project.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install Composer
    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

You can add Guzzle as a dependency using the composer.phar CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

    php composer.phar require addwiki/mediawiki-api-base:~2.0

Alternatively, you can specify Guzzle as a dependency in your project's
existing composer.json file:

.. code-block:: js

    {
      "require": {
         "addwiki/mediawiki-api-base": "~2.0"
      }
   }

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

.. code-block:: php

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and
other best-practices for defining dependencies at `getcomposer.org <http://getcomposer.org>`_.


Bleeding edge
--------------------------

During your development, you can keep up with the latest changes on the master
branch by setting the version requirement for Guzzle to ``~2.0@dev``.

.. code-block:: js

   {
      "require": {
         "guzzlehttp/guzzle": "~2.0@dev"
      }
   }

Running the tests
-----------------

In order to contribute, you'll need to checkout the source from GitHub and
install the dependencies using Composer:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/addwiki/mediawiki-api-base.git
    cd mediawiki-api-base
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    ./composer.phar install --dev

The library is tested with a combination of linters and phpunit. Run all of the tests as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./composer.phar test

You can choose to run each part of the whole test suite individually using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run the linting only
    ./composer.phar lint
    # Run phpunit only
    ./composer.phar phpunit
    # Run only the phpunit unit tests
    ./composer.phar phpunit-unit
    # Run only the phpunit integration tests
    ./composer.phar phpunit-integration
